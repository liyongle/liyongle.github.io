### What drove me to write this blog?

Around one week after [openEuler](https://openeuler.org) was opened, [It's FOSS](https://itsfoss.com/) reported [Huawei’s Linux Distribution openEuler is Available Now!](https://itsfoss.com/openeuler/). Then I checked the blog, and found one interesting [comment](https://itsfoss.com/openeuler/#comments/329624). 

```
no, I don’t want to use anything from huawei. for those think they are harmless because you are not american, think about how chinese robbed european and japanese high speed technology and claimed as their own.
```

I am not sensitive to politics. I don't sensitive to some statement like Chinese is bad because 

1. the concept `Chinese` is a set. such statement is true only every single element in the set has the same feature.

2. Firstly I am a humman being, and it happened that I live in China, `pay taxes` in China thus I am a Chinese. 

But this time is a little different, because I am operating openEuler and I have to be sensitive to any comments under such blogs.

### Are we thieves when we use OSS?

To be honest, **YES and NO**. 

No, when you follow the license, respect the copyright of the author, it is not only leal, but also encouraged. This is what OSS is for.

Yes, when you don't care about OSS license, or the IP (intelligent proprietary).

And, when I met the following cases this week, I have to accept that *stealing* is popular in China. 

#### Case 1, Wrong license

When I read [this](https://gitee.com/open_euler/dashboard/issues?id=I18FZD), I didn't know what to say for a while.

> the src/json package seems to be based on https://github.com/containers/libocispec. In particular on the https://github.com/containers/libocispec/blob/master/src/generate.py file.

> The generate.py file from libocispec is distributed under the GPLv3 license.

>The original copyright was dropped and the derivative source switched to use the Mulan PSL v1 license.

> The GPLv3 license doesn't allow that.

> As author of libocispec, I am interested in the improvements you've done.

Nothing to say, it is licese usage issue, nothing more, nothing less. I hope so.

#### Case 2, Module Management Languange? Python?

Sorry, this news is in Chinese. https://www.ednchina.com/news/202001171403.html

If it had happened 10 years ago, I could somehow understand. It is happening nowadays, I am really shocked. 


### What to do?

Yesterday one colleague told me that I was easilly angry recently. I replied that please go to see the issues in openEuler. If the managers, not only developers are reading the issues, I would not be such upset and angry. 

But, I am always supposed to change the situation, not beaten by the situation. I would do encourage whoever to:

1. In your blogs/emails/reports, write down the authors if theirs are quoted.

2. Your reputation is not for sale. Respect your intelligent proprietaries, and others'.

3. Point out bad behaviors publicly. 

It is very touph to change the mindset, so I only share my thoughts.
